Briefing Note: Post-pandemic mortality dynamics: historical city-level evidence
(Angelopoulos, K. , Lazarakis, S., Mancy, R. and Schroeder, M. (2020))

The file "Code" contains:

	1. An R codefile that creates all the Graphs.
	2. A MATLAB codefile that runs the counterfactual simulations used in Figure 6.

The file "Data" contains all the data used in the production of the graphs:

	1. GGC-QuarterlyDeathRates contains the quarterly death rates for the Greater Glasgow and Clyde Area during and 
	   preceeding the COVID19 outbreak.
	2. Glasgow_MOH_Deaths_1898-1972 contains the death rates from different diseases underlying the calculations in the note. 
	3. HP_Filtered_RespDiseases contains the detrended values used for plotting deaths from respiratory diseases.
	4. MOG Spanish Influenza Deaths contains the quarterly mortality rates around the 1918/19 Influenza outbreak in Glasgow.
	5. Resp_StandardDev contains the rolling standard deviation of deaths from respiratory diseases.
	6. Resp_StandardDevCounterfactual contains the rolling standard deviation of deaths from respiratory diseases using the counterfactual assumption.

The file "Figures" contains all the figures.
